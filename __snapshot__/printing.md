# chrome.printing

**Important:** This API works **only on ChromeOS**.

## Description

Use the `chrome.printing` API to send print jobs to printers installed on Chromebook.

## Permissions

`printing`

## Availability

Chrome 81+ ChromeOS only

All `chrome.printing` methods and events require you to declare the `"printing"` permission in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest). For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "printing"
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Examples

The examples below demonstrate using each of the methods in the printing namespace. This code is copied from or based on the [api-samples/printing](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/printing) in the extensions-samples Github repo.

### cancelJob()

This example uses the `onJobStatusChanged` handler to hide a 'cancel' button when the `jobStatus` is neither `PENDING` or `IN_PROGRESS`. Note that on some networks or when a Chromebook is connected directly to the printer, these states may pass too quickly for the cancel button to be visible long enough to be called. This is greatly simplified printing example.

```
chrome.printing.onJobStatusChanged.addListener((jobId, status) => {
  const cancelButton = document.getElementById("cancelButton");
  cancelButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    chrome.printing.cancelJob(jobId).then((response) => {
      if (response !== undefined) {
        console.log(response.status);
      }
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError !== undefined) {
        console.log(chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
      }
    });
  });
  if (status !== "PENDING" && status !== "IN_PROGRESS") {
    cancelButton.style.visibility = 'hidden';
  } else {
    cancelButton.style.visibility = 'visible';
  }
}
```

### getPrinters() and getPrinterInfo()

A single example is used for these functions because getting printer information requires a printer ID, which is retrieved by calling `getPrinters()`. This example logs the name and description of the default printer to the console. This is a simplified version of the printing example.

```
​​const printers = await chrome.printing.getPrinters();
const defaultPrinter = printers.find((printer) => {
  const printerInfo = await chrome.printing.getPrinterInfo(printer.id);
  return printerInfo.isDefault;
}
console.log(`Default printer: ${defaultPrinter.name}.\n\t${defaultPrinter.description}`);
```

### submitJob()

The `submitJob()` method requires three things.

- A `ticket` structure specifying which capabilities of the printer are to be used. If the user needs to select from available capabilities, you can retrieve them for a specific printer using `getPrinterInfo()`.
- A `SubmitJobRequest` structure, which specifies the printer to use, and the file or data to print. This structure contains a reference to the `ticket` structure.
- A blob of the file or data to print.

Calling `submitJob()` triggers a dialog box asking the user to confirm printing. Use the [`PrintingAPIExtensionsAllowlist`](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#PrintingAPIExtensionsAllowlist%22) to bypass confirmation.

This is a simplified version of the printing example. Notice that the `ticket` is attached to the `SubmitJobRequest` structure (line 8) and that the data to print is converted to a blob (line 10). Getting the ID of the printer (line 1) is more complicated [in the sample](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/printing) than is shown here.

```
const defaultPrinter = getDefaultPrinter();
const ticket = getPrinterTicket(defaultPrinter);
const arrayBuffer = getPrintData();
const submitJobRequest = {
  job: {
    printerId: defaultPrinter,
    title: 'test job',
    ticket: ticket,
    contentType: 'application/pdf',
    document: new Blob([new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer)], {
      type: 'application/pdf'
    });
  }
};

chrome.printing.submitJob(submitJobRequest, (response) => {
  if (response !== undefined) {
    console.log(response.status);
  }
  if (chrome.runtime.lastError !== undefined) {
    console.log(chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
  }
});
```

### Roll printing

This example shows how to build a printer ticket for continuous (or roll) printing, which is often used with receipt printing. The `submitJobRequest` object for roll printing is the same as that shown for the [`submitJob()`](#submitjob) example.

If you need to change the default value for paper cutting, use the `vendor_ticket_item` key. (The default varies from printer to printer.) To change the value, provide an array with one member: an object whose `id` is `'finishings'`. The value can either be `'trim'` for printers that cut the roll at the end of printing or `'none'` for printers that require the print job to be torn off.

```
const ticket = {
  version: '1.0',
  print: {
    vendor_ticket_item: [{id: 'finishings', value: 'trim'}],
    color: {type: 'STANDARD_MONOCHROME'},
    duplex: {type: 'NO_DUPLEX'},
    page_orientation: {type: 'PORTRAIT'},
    copies: {copies: 1},
    dpi: {horizontal_dpi: 300, vertical_dpi: 300},
    media_size: {
      width_microns: 72320,
      height_microns: 100000
    },
    collate: {collate: false}
  }
};
```

Some printers do not support the `"finishings"` option. To determine if your printer does, call [`getPrinterInfo()`](#method-getPrinterInfo) and look for a `"display_name"` of `"finishings/11"`.

```
"vendor_capability": [
  {
    "display_name": "finishings/11",
    "id": "finishings/11",
    "type": "TYPED_VALUE",
    "typed_value_cap": {
      "value_type": "BOOLEAN"
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

**Note:** starting with Chrome 124, the `vendor_ticket_item` allows all items from the printer's `vendor_capabilities`. For example, any value return by [`getPrinterInfo()`](#method-getPrinterInfo) is valid. Before, only the `finishings` key was supported.

The values in a ticket's `media_size` key are specific to each printer. To select an appropriate size call [`getPrinterInfo()`](#method-getPrinterInfo). The returned [`GetPrinterResponse`](#type-GetPrinterInfoResponse) contains an array of supported media sizes at `"media_size"."option"`. Choose an option whose `"is_continuous_feed"` value is true. Use its height and width values for the ticket.

```
"media_size": {
  "option": [
  {
    "custom_display_name": "",
    "is_continuous_feed": true,
    "max_height_microns": 2000000,
    "min_height_microns": 25400,
    "width_microns": 50800
  },
  ...
  ]
}
```

chrome.printing.cancelJob(
  jobId: string,
): Promise<void>
```

Cancels previously submitted job.

#### Parameters

### getJobStatus()

Chrome 135+

```
chrome.printing.getJobStatus(
  jobId: string,
): Promise<JobStatus>
```

Returns the status of the print job. This call will fail with a runtime error if the print job with the given `jobId` doesn't exist. `jobId`: The id of the print job to return the status of. This should be the same id received in a [`SubmitJobResponse`](#type-SubmitJobResponse).

#### Parameters

- jobId
  
  string

#### Returns

- Promise&lt;[JobStatus](#type-JobStatus)&gt;

### getPrinterInfo()

```
chrome.printing.getPrinterInfo(
  printerId: string,
): Promise<GetPrinterInfoResponse>
```

Returns the status and capabilities of the printer in [CDD format](https://developers.google.com/cloud-print/docs/cdd#cdd). This call will fail with a runtime error if no printers with given id are installed.

#### Parameters
