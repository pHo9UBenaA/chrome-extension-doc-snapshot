# chrome.cookies

## Description

Use the `chrome.cookies` API to query and modify cookies, and to be notified when they change.

## Permissions

`cookies`

To use the cookies API, declare the `"cookies"` permission in your manifest along with [host permissions](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions) for any hosts whose cookies you want to access. For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "host_permissions": [
    "*://*.google.com/"
  ],
  "permissions": [
    "cookies"
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Partitioning

[Partitioned cookies](/docs/privacy-sandbox/chips) allow a site to mark that certain cookies should be keyed against the origin of the top-level frame. This means that, for example, if site A is embedded using an iframe in site B and site C, the embedded versions of a partitioned cookie from A can have different values on B and C.

By default, all API methods operate on unpartitioned cookies. The [`partitionKey`](#type-CookiePartitionKey) property can be used to override this behavior.

For details on the general impact of partitioning for extensions, see [Storage and Cookies](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/storage-and-cookies#cookies-partitioning).

## Examples

You can find a simple example of using the cookies API in the [examples/api/cookies](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/cookies/cookie-clearer) directory. For other examples and for help in viewing the source code, see [Samples](/docs/extensions/samples).

## Types

### Cookie

Represents information about an HTTP cookie.

#### Properties

- domain
  
  string
  
  The domain of the cookie (e.g. "www.google.com", "example.com").
- expirationDate
  
  number optional
  
  The expiration date of the cookie as the number of seconds since the UNIX epoch. Not provided for session cookies.
- hostOnly
  
  boolean
  
  True if the cookie is a host-only cookie (i.e. a request's host must exactly match the domain of the cookie).
- httpOnly
  
  boolean
  
  True if the cookie is marked as HttpOnly (i.e. the cookie is inaccessible to client-side scripts).
- name
  
  string
  
  The name of the cookie.
- partitionKey
  
  [CookiePartitionKey](#type-CookiePartitionKey) optional
  
  Chrome 119+
  
  The partition key for reading or modifying cookies with the Partitioned attribute.
- path
  
  string
  
  The path of the cookie.
- sameSite
  
  [SameSiteStatus](#type-SameSiteStatus)
  
  Chrome 51+
  
  The cookie's same-site status (i.e. whether the cookie is sent with cross-site requests).
- secure
  
  boolean
  
  True if the cookie is marked as Secure (i.e. its scope is limited to secure channels, typically HTTPS).
- session
  
  boolean
  
  True if the cookie is a session cookie, as opposed to a persistent cookie with an expiration date.
- storeId
  
  string
  
  The ID of the cookie store containing this cookie, as provided in getAllCookieStores().
- value
  
  string
  
  The value of the cookie.

### CookieDetails

Chrome 88+

Details to identify the cookie.

#### Properties

- name
  
  string
  
  The name of the cookie to access.
- partitionKey
  
  [CookiePartitionKey](#type-CookiePartitionKey) optional
  
  Chrome 119+
  
  The partition key for reading or modifying cookies with the Partitioned attribute.
- storeId
  
  string optional
  
  The ID of the cookie store in which to look for the cookie. By default, the current execution context's cookie store will be used.
- url
  
  string
  
  The URL with which the cookie to access is associated. This argument may be a full URL, in which case any data following the URL path (e.g. the query string) is simply ignored. If host permissions for this URL are not specified in the manifest file, the API call will fail.

### CookiePartitionKey

Chrome 119+

Represents a partitioned cookie's partition key.

#### Properties

- hasCrossSiteAncestor
  
  boolean optional
  
  Chrome 130+
  
  Indicates if the cookie was set in a cross-cross site context. This prevents a top-level site embedded in a cross-site context from accessing cookies set by the top-level site in a same-site context.
- topLevelSite
  
  string optional
  
  The top-level site the partitioned cookie is available in.

### CookieStore

Represents a cookie store in the browser. An incognito mode window, for instance, uses a separate cookie store from a non-incognito window.

#### Properties

- id
  
  string
  
  The unique identifier for the cookie store.
- tabIds
  
  number\[]
  
  Identifiers of all the browser tabs that share this cookie store.

### FrameDetails

Chrome 132+

Details to identify the frame.

#### Properties

- documentId
  
  string optional
  
  The unique identifier for the document. If the frameId and/or tabId are provided they will be validated to match the document found by provided document ID.
- frameId
  
  number optional
  
  The unique identifier for the frame within the tab.
- tabId
  
  number optional
  
  The unique identifier for the tab containing the frame.

### OnChangedCause

Chrome 44+

The underlying reason behind the cookie's change. If a cookie was inserted, or removed via an explicit call to "chrome.cookies.remove", "cause" will be "explicit". If a cookie was automatically removed due to expiry, "cause" will be "expired". If a cookie was removed due to being overwritten with an already-expired expiration date, "cause" will be set to "expired\_overwrite". If a cookie was automatically removed due to garbage collection, "cause" will be "evicted". If a cookie was automatically removed due to a "set" call that overwrote it, "cause" will be "overwrite". Plan your response accordingly.

#### Enum

"evicted"

"expired"

"explicit"

"expired\_overwrite"

"overwrite"

### SameSiteStatus

Chrome 51+

A cookie's 'SameSite' state (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies). 'no\_restriction' corresponds to a cookie set with 'SameSite=None', 'lax' to 'SameSite=Lax', and 'strict' to 'SameSite=Strict'. 'unspecified' corresponds to a cookie set without the SameSite attribute.

#### Enum

"no\_restriction"

"lax"

"strict"

"unspecified"

## Methods

### get()

```
chrome.cookies.get(
  details: CookieDetails,
): Promise<Cookie | undefined>
```

Retrieves information about a single cookie. If more than one cookie of the same name exists for the given URL, the one with the longest path will be returned. For cookies with the same path length, the cookie with the earliest creation time will be returned.

### getAll()

```
chrome.cookies.getAll(
  details: object,
): Promise<Cookie[]>
```

Retrieves all cookies from a single cookie store that match the given information. The cookies returned will be sorted, with those with the longest path first. If multiple cookies have the same path length, those with the earliest creation time will be first. This method only retrieves cookies for domains that the extension has host permissions to.

## Events

### onChanged

```
chrome.cookies.onChanged.addListener(
  callback: function,
)
```

Fired when a cookie is set or removed. As a special case, note that updating a cookie's properties is implemented as a two step process: the cookie to be updated is first removed entirely, generating a notification with "cause" of "overwrite" . Afterwards, a new cookie is written with the updated values, generating a second notification with "cause" "explicit".

#### Parameters

- callback
  
  function
  
  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  
  ```
  (changeInfo: object) => void
  ```
  
  - changeInfo
    
    object
    
    - cause
      
      [OnChangedCause](#type-OnChangedCause)
      
      The underlying reason behind the cookie's change.
    - cookie
      
      [Cookie](#type-Cookie)
      
      Information about the cookie that was set or removed.
    - removed
      
      boolean
