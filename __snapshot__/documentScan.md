# chrome.documentScan

**Important:** This API works **only on ChromeOS**.

## Description

Use the `chrome.documentScan` API to discover and retrieve images from attached document scanners.

The Document Scan API is designed to allow apps and extensions to view the content of paper documents on an attached document scanner.

## Permissions

`documentScan`

## Availability

Chrome 44+ ChromeOS only

Availability for API members added later is shown with those members.

## Concepts and usage

This API supports two means of scanning documents. If your use case can work with any scanner and doesn't require control of the configuration, use the `scan()` method. More complicated use cases require a combination of methods, which are only supported in Chrome 124 and later.

### Simple scanning

For simple use cases, meaning those that can work with any scanner and don't require control of configuration, call `scan()`. This method takes a `ScanOptions` object and returns a Promise that resolves with a `ScanResults` object. The capabilities of this option are limited to the number of scans and the MIME types that will be accepted by the caller. Scans are returned as URLs for display in an `<img>` tag for a user interface.

### Complex scanning

Complex scans are accomplished in three phases as described in this section. This outline does not describe every method argument or every property returned in a response. It is only intended to give you a general guide to writing scanner code.

**Note:** Calling [`openScanner()`](#method-openscanner), [`getScannerList()`](#method-getscannerlist), or [`startScan()`](#method-startscan) more than once will cancel operations initiated by previous calls to these methods. See the descriptions of these methods for specifics.

#### Discovery

1. Call [`getScannerList()`](#method-getscannerlist). Available scanners are returned in a Promise that resolves with a [`GetScannerListResponse`](#type-getscannerlistresponse).
   
   - The response object contains an array of [`ScannerInfo`](#type-scannerinfo) objects.
   - The array may contain multiple entries for a single scanner if that scanner supports multiple protocols or connection methods.
2. Select a scanner from the returned array and save the value of its `scannerId` property.
   
   Use the properties of individual `ScannerInfo` objects to distinguish among multiple objects for the same scanner. Objects from the same scanner will have the same value for the `deviceUuid` property. `ScannerInfo` also contains an `imageFormats` property containing an array of supported image types.

#### Scanner configuration

1. Call [`openScanner()`](#method-openscanner), passing in the saved scanner ID. It returns a Promise that resolves with an [`OpenScannerResponse`](#type-openscannerresponse). The response object contains:
   
   - A `scannerHandle` property, which you'll need to save.
   - An options property containing scanner-specific properties, which you'll need to set. See Retrieve scanner options for more information.
2. (Optional) If you need the user to provide values for scanner options, construct a user interface. You will need the scanner options provided by the previous step, and you'll need to retrieve option groups provided by the scanner. See [Construct a user interface](/docs/extensions/develop/ui) for more information.
3. Construct an array of [`OptionSetting`](#type-optionsetting) objects using programmatic or user-provided values. See Set scanner options for more information.
4. Pass the array of `OptionSetting` objects to [`setOptions()`](#method-setoptions) to set options for the scanner. It returns a Promise that resolves with a [`SetOptionsResponse`](#type-setoptionsresponse). This object contains an updated version of the scanner options retrieved in step 1 of scanner configuration.
   
   Since changing one option can alter constraints on another option, you may need to repeat these steps several times.

#### Scanning

1. Construct a [`StartScanOptions`](#type-startscanoptions) object and pass it to [`startScan()`](#method-startscan). It returns a Promise that resolves with a [`StartScanResponse`](#type-startscanresponse). Its `job` property is a handle that you will use to either read scan data or cancel the scan.
2. Pass the job handle to [`readScanData()`](#method-readscandata). It returns a Promise that resolves with a [`ReadScanDataResponse`](#type-readscandataresponse) object. If data was read successfully, its `result` property equals `SUCCESS` and its `data` property contains an [`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) with part of the scan. Note that `estimatedCompletion` contains an estimated percentage of the total data that has been delivered so far.
   
   **Note:** If `result` is `SUCCESS`, but `data` is empty, delay briefly before calling `readScanData()` again.
3. Repeat the previous step until the `result` property equals `EOF` or an error.

When the end of the scan is reached, call [`closeScanner()`](#method-closescanner) with the scanner handle saved in step 3. It returns a Promise that resolves with a [`CloseScannerResponse`](#type-closescannerresponse). Calling [`cancelScan()`](#method-cancelscan) at any time after the job is created will end scanning.

### Response objects

All methods return a Promise that resolves with a response object of some kind. Most of these contain a `result` property whose value is a member of [`OperationResult`](#type-operationresult). Some properties of response objects won't contain values unless the value of `result` has a specific value. These relationships are described in the reference for each response object.

For example, `OpenScannerResponse.scannerHandle` will only have a value when `OpenScannerResponse.result` equals `SUCCESS`.

### Scanner options

Scanner options vary considerably by device. Consequently, it's not possible to reflect scanner options directly within the documentScan API. To get around this, the [`OpenScannerResponse`](#type-openscannerresponse) (retrieved using [`openScanner()`](#method-openscanner)) and the [`SetOptionsResponse`](#type-setoptionsresponse) (the response object for [`setOptions()`](#method-setoptions)) contain an `options` property which is an object containing scanner-specific options. Each option is a key-value mapping where the key is a device-specific option and the value is an instance of [`ScannerOption`](#type-scanneroption).

The structure generally looks like this:

```
{
  "key1": { scannerOptionInstance }
  "key2": { scannerOptionInstance }
}
```

For example, imagine a scanner that returns options named "source" and "resolution". The structure of the returned `options` object will look something like the following example. For simplicity, only partial `ScannerOption` responses are shown.

```
{
  "source": {
    "name": "source",
    "type": OptionType.STRING,
...
},
  "resolution": {
    "name": "resolution",
    "type": OptionType.INT,
...
  },
...
}
```

### Construct a user interface

Though not required to use this API, you may want a user to choose the value for a particular option. This requires a user interface. Use the [`OpenScannerResponse`](#type-openscannerresponse) (opened by [`openScanner()`](#type-openscanner)) to retrieve the options for the attached scanner as described in the previous section.

Some scanners group options in device-specific ways. They don't affect option behaviors, but since these groups may be mentioned in a scanner's product documentation, such groups should be shown to the user. You can retrieve these groups by calling [`getOptionGroups()`](#method-getoptionsgroup). This returns a Promise that resolves with a [`GetOptionGroupsResponse`](#type-getoptiongroupsreponse) object. Its `groups` property contains a scanner-specific array of groups. Use the information in these groups to organize the options in the [`OpenScannerResponse`](#type-openscannerresponse) for display.

```
{
  scannerHandle: "123456",
  result: SUCCESS,
  groups: [
    {
      title: "Standard",
      members: [ "resolution", "mode", "source" ]
    }
  ]
}
```

As stated under Scanner configuration, changing one option can alter constraints on another option. This is why [`setOptionsResponse`](#method-setoptionsresponse) (the response object for [`setOptions()`](#method-setoptions)) contains another `options` property. Use this to update the user interface. Then repeat as needed until all options are set.

### Set scanner options

Set scanner options by passing an array of [`OptionSetting`](#type-optionsetting) objects to [`setOptions()`](#method-setoptions). For an example, see the following [Scan one letter-size page](#scan_one_letter-size_page) section.

## Examples

### Retrieve a page as a blob

This example shows one way to retrieve a page from the scanner as a blob and demonstrates use of `startScan()` and `readScanData()` using the value of `OperationResult`.

```
async function pageAsBlob(handle) {
  let response = await chrome.documentScan.startScan(
      handle, {format: "image/jpeg"});
  if (response.result != chrome.documentScan.OperationResult.SUCCESS) {
    return null;
  }
  const job = response.job;

  let imgParts = [];
  response = await chrome.documentScan.readScanData(job);
  while (response.result == chrome.documentScan.OperationResult.SUCCESS) {
    if (response.data && response.data.byteLength > 0) {
        imgParts.push(response.data);
    } else {
      // Delay so hardware can make progress.
      await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 100));
    }
    response = await chrome.documentScan.readScanData(job);
  }
  if (response.result != chrome.documentScan.OperationResult.EOF) {
    return null;
  }
  if (response.data && response.data.byteLength > 0) {
    imgParts.push(response.data);
  }
  return new Blob(imgParts, { type: "image/jpeg" });
}
```

### Scan one letter-size page

This example shows how to select a scanner, set its options, and open it. It then retrieves the contents of a single page and closes the scanner. This process demonstrates using `getScannerList()`, `openScanner()`, `setOptions()`, and `closeScanner()`. Note that the contents of the page are retrieved by calling the `pageAsBlob()` function from the previous example.

```
async function scan() {
    let response = await chrome.documentScan.getScannerList({ secure: true });
    let scanner = await chrome.documentScan.openScanner(
        response.scanners[0].scannerId);
    const handle = scanner.scannerHandle;

    let options = [];
    for (source of scanner.options["source"].constraint.list) {
        if (source.includes("ADF")) {
            options.push({
                name: "source",
                type: chrome.documentScan.OptionType.STRING,
                value: { value: source }
            });
            break;
        }
    }
    options.push({
        name: "tl-x",
        type: chrome.documentScan.OptionType.FIXED,
        value: 0.0
    });
    options.push({
        name: "br-x",
        type: chrome.documentScan.OptionType.FIXED,
        value: 215.9  // 8.5" in mm
    });
    options.push({
        name: "tl-y",
        type: chrome.documentScan.OptionType.FIXED,
        value: 0.0
    });
    options.push({
        name: "br-y",
        type: chrome.documentScan.OptionType.FIXED,
        value: 279.4  // 11" in mm
    });
    response = await chrome.documentScan.setOptions(handle, options);

    let imgBlob = await pageAsBlob(handle);
    if (imgBlob != null) {
        // Insert imgBlob into DOM, save to disk, etc
    }
    await chrome.documentScan.closeScanner(handle);
}
```

### Show the configuration

As stated elsewhere, showing a scanner's configuration options to a user requires calling `getOptionGroups()` in addition to the scanner options returned from a call to `openScanner()`. This is so that options can be shown to users in manufacturer-defined groups. This example shows how to do that.

```
async function showConfig() {
  let response = await chrome.documentScan.getScannerList({ secure: true });
  let scanner = await chrome.documentScan.openScanner(
      response.scanners[0].scannerId);
  let groups = await chrome.documentScan.getOptionGroups(scanner.scannerHandle);

  for (const group of groups.groups) {
    console.log("=== " + group.title + " ===");
    for (const member of group.members) {
      const option = scanner.options[member];
      if (option.isActive) {
        console.log("  " + option.name + " = " + option.value);
      } else {
        console.log("  " + option.name + " is inactive");
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Methods

### cancelScan()

Chrome 125+

```
chrome.documentScan.cancelScan(
  job: string,
): Promise<CancelScanResponse>
```

Cancels a started scan and returns a Promise that resolves with a [`CancelScanResponse`](#type-CancelScanResponse) object. If a callback is used, the object is passed to it instead.

#### Parameters

- job
  
  string
  
  The handle of an active scan job previously returned from a call to [`startScan`](#method-startScan).

#### Returns

- Promise&lt;[CancelScanResponse](#type-CancelScanResponse)&gt;

### closeScanner()

Chrome 125+

```
chrome.documentScan.closeScanner(
  scannerHandle: string,
): Promise<CloseScannerResponse>
```

Closes the scanner with the passed in handle and returns a Promise that resolves with a [`CloseScannerResponse`](#type-CloseScannerResponse) object. If a callback is used, the object is passed to it instead. Even if the response is not a success, the supplied handle becomes invalid and should not be used for further operations.

#### Parameters

### getOptionGroups()

Chrome 125+

```
chrome.documentScan.getOptionGroups(
  scannerHandle: string,
): Promise<GetOptionGroupsResponse>
```

Gets the group names and member options from a scanner previously opened by [`openScanner`](#method-openScanner). This method returns a Promise that resolves with a [`GetOptionGroupsResponse`](#type-GetOptionGroupsResponse) object. If a callback is passed to this function, returned data is passed to it instead.

#### Parameters

- scannerHandle
  
  string
  
  The handle of an open scanner returned from a call to [`openScanner`](#method-openScanner).

#### Returns

- Promise&lt;[GetOptionGroupsResponse](#type-GetOptionGroupsResponse)&gt;

### getScannerList()

Chrome 125+

```
chrome.documentScan.getScannerList(
  filter: DeviceFilter,
): Promise<GetScannerListResponse>
```

Gets the list of available scanners and returns a Promise that resolves with a [`GetScannerListResponse`](#type-GetScannerListResponse) object. If a callback is passed to this function, returned data is passed to it instead.

#### Parameters

- filter
  
  [DeviceFilter](#type-DeviceFilter)
  
  A [`DeviceFilter`](#type-DeviceFilter) indicating which types of scanners should be returned.

#### Returns

- Promise&lt;[GetScannerListResponse](#type-GetScannerListResponse)&gt;

### openScanner()

Chrome 125+

```
chrome.documentScan.openScanner(
  scannerId: string,
): Promise<OpenScannerResponse>
```

Opens a scanner for exclusive access and returns a Promise that resolves with an [`OpenScannerResponse`](#type-OpenScannerResponse) object. If a callback is passed to this function, returned data is passed to it instead.

#### Parameters

- scannerId
  
  string
  
  The ID of a scanner to be opened. This value is one returned from a previous call to [`getScannerList`](#method-getScannerList).

#### Returns

- Promise&lt;[OpenScannerResponse](#type-OpenScannerResponse)&gt;

### readScanData()

Chrome 125+

```
chrome.documentScan.readScanData(
  job: string,
): Promise<ReadScanDataResponse>
```

Reads the next chunk of available image data from an active job handle, and returns a Promise that resolves with a [`ReadScanDataResponse`](#type-ReadScanDataResponse) object. If a callback is used, the object is passed to it instead.

\*\*Note:\*\*It is valid for a response result to be `SUCCESS` with a zero-length `data` member. This means the scanner is still working but does not yet have additional data ready. The caller should wait a short time and try again.

When the scan job completes, the response will have the result value of `EOF`. This response may contain a final non-zero `data` member.

#### Parameters

- job
  
  string
  
  Active job handle previously returned from [`startScan`](#method-startScan).

#### Returns

- Promise&lt;[ReadScanDataResponse](#type-ReadScanDataResponse)&gt;

### scan()

```
chrome.documentScan.scan(
  options: ScanOptions,
): Promise<ScanResults>
```

Performs a document scan and returns a Promise that resolves with a [`ScanResults`](#type-ScanResults) object. If a callback is passed to this function, the returned data is passed to it instead.

#### Parameters

- options
  
  [ScanOptions](#type-ScanOptions)
  
  An object containing scan parameters.

#### Returns

- Promise&lt;[ScanResults](#type-ScanResults)&gt;
  
  Chrome 96+

### setOptions()

Chrome 125+

```
chrome.documentScan.setOptions(
  scannerHandle: string,
  options: OptionSetting[],
): Promise<SetOptionsResponse>
```

Sets options on the specified scanner and returns a Promise that resolves with a [`SetOptionsResponse`](#type-SetOptionsResponse) object containing the result of trying to set every value in the order of the passed-in [`OptionSetting`](#type-OptionSetting) object. If a callback is used, the object is passed to it instead.

#### Parameters

- scannerHandle
  
  string
  
  The handle of the scanner to set options on. This should be a value previously returned from a call to [`openScanner`](#method-openScanner).
- options
  
  [OptionSetting](#type-OptionSetting)\[]
  
  A list of `OptionSetting` objects to be applied to the scanner.

#### Returns

- Promise&lt;[SetOptionsResponse](#type-SetOptionsResponse)&gt;

### startScan()

```
chrome.documentScan.startScan(
  scannerHandle: string,
  options: StartScanOptions,
): Promise<StartScanResponse>
```

Starts a scan on the specified scanner and returns a Promise that resolves with a [`StartScanResponse`](#type-StartScanResponse). If a callback is used, the object is passed to it instead. If the call was successful, the response includes a job handle that can be used in subsequent calls to read scan data or cancel a scan.

#### Parameters
