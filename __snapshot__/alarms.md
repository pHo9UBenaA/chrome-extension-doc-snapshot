# chrome.alarms

**Chrome 120:** Starting in Chrome 120, the minimum alarm interval has been reduced from 1 minute to 30 seconds. For an alarm to trigger in 30 seconds, set `periodInMinutes: 0.5`.  
**Chrome 117:** Starting in Chrome 117, the number of active alarms is limited to 500. Once this limit is reached, `chrome.alarms.create()` will fail. When using a callback, [`chrome.runtime.lastError`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/runtime#property-lastError) will be set. When using promises, the promise will be rejected.

## Description

Use the `chrome.alarms` API to schedule code to run periodically or at a specified time in the future.

## Permissions

`alarms`

To use the `chrome.alarms` API, declare the `"alarms"` permission in the [manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest):

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "alarms"
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Concepts and usage

To ensure reliable behavior, it is helpful to understand how the API behaves.

### Device sleep

Alarms continue to run while a device is sleeping. However, an alarm will not wake up a device. When the device wakes up, any missed alarms will fire. Repeating alarms will fire at most once and then be rescheduled using the specified period starting from when the device wakes, not taking into account any time that has already elapsed since the alarm was originally set to run.

### Persistence

Alarms generally persist until an extension is updated. However, this is not guaranteed, and alarms may be cleared when the browser is restarted. Consequently, consider setting a value in storage when an alarm is created, and then ensure it exists each time your service worker starts up. For example:

```
const STORAGE_KEY = "user-preference-alarm-enabled";

async function checkAlarmState() {
  const { alarmEnabled } = await chrome.storage.get(STORAGE_KEY);

  if (alarmEnabled) {
    const alarm = await chrome.alarms.get("my-alarm");

    if (!alarm) {
      await chrome.alarms.create({ periodInMinutes: 1 });
    }
  }
}

checkAlarmState();
```

## Examples

The following examples show how to use and respond to an alarm. To try this API, install the [Alarm API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/alarms) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples) repository.

### Set an alarm

The following example sets an alarm in the service worker when the extension is installed:

service-worker.js:

```
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(async ({ reason }) => {
  if (reason !== 'install') {
    return;
  }

  // Create an alarm so we have something to look at in the demo
  await chrome.alarms.create('demo-default-alarm', {
    delayInMinutes: 1,
    periodInMinutes: 1
  });
});
```

### Respond to an alarm

The following example sets the [action toolbar icon](/docs/extensions/reference/api/action#icon) based on the name of the alarm that went off.

service-worker.js:

```
chrome.alarms.onAlarm.addListener((alarm) => {
  chrome.action.setIcon({
    path: getIconPath(alarm.name),
  });
});
```

## Types

### Alarm

#### Properties

- name
  
  string
  
  Name of this alarm.
- periodInMinutes
  
  number optional
  
  If not null, the alarm is a repeating alarm and will fire again in `periodInMinutes` minutes.
- scheduledTime
  
  number
  
  Time at which this alarm was scheduled to fire, in milliseconds past the epoch (e.g. `Date.now() + n`). For performance reasons, the alarm may have been delayed an arbitrary amount beyond this.

### AlarmCreateInfo

#### Properties

- delayInMinutes
  
  number optional
  
  Length of time in minutes after which the `onAlarm` event should fire.
- periodInMinutes
  
  number optional
  
  If set, the onAlarm event should fire every `periodInMinutes` minutes after the initial event specified by `when` or `delayInMinutes`. If not set, the alarm will only fire once.
- when
  
  number optional
  
  Time at which the alarm should fire, in milliseconds past the epoch (e.g. `Date.now() + n`).

## Methods

### clear()

Promise

```
chrome.alarms.clear(
  name?: string,
  callback?: function,
)
```

Clears the alarm with the given name.

#### Parameters

- name
  
  string optional
  
  The name of the alarm to clear. Defaults to the empty string.
- callback
  
  function optional
  
  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  
  ```
  (wasCleared: boolean) => void
  ```
  
  - wasCleared
    
    boolean

#### Returns

- Promise&lt;boolean&gt;
  
  Chrome 91+
  
  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### clearAll()

Promise

```
chrome.alarms.clearAll(
  callback?: function,
)
```

Clears all alarms.

#### Parameters

- callback
  
  function optional
  
  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  
  ```
  (wasCleared: boolean) => void
  ```
  
  - wasCleared
    
    boolean

#### Returns

- Promise&lt;boolean&gt;
  
  Chrome 91+
  
  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### create()

Promise

```
chrome.alarms.create(
  name?: string,
  alarmInfo: AlarmCreateInfo,
  callback?: function,
)
```

Creates an alarm. Near the time(s) specified by `alarmInfo`, the `onAlarm` event is fired. If there is another alarm with the same name (or no name if none is specified), it will be cancelled and replaced by this alarm.

In order to reduce the load on the user's machine, Chrome limits alarms to at most once every 30 seconds but may delay them an arbitrary amount more. That is, setting `delayInMinutes` or `periodInMinutes` to less than `0.5` will not be honored and will cause a warning. `when` can be set to less than 30 seconds after "now" without warning but won't actually cause the alarm to fire for at least 30 seconds.

To help you debug your app or extension, when you've loaded it unpacked, there's no limit to how often the alarm can fire.

#### Parameters

- name
  
  string optional
  
  Optional name to identify this alarm. Defaults to the empty string.
- alarmInfo
  
  [AlarmCreateInfo](#type-AlarmCreateInfo)
  
  Describes when the alarm should fire. The initial time must be specified by either `when` or `delayInMinutes` (but not both). If `periodInMinutes` is set, the alarm will repeat every `periodInMinutes` minutes after the initial event. If neither `when` or `delayInMinutes` is set for a repeating alarm, `periodInMinutes` is used as the default for `delayInMinutes`.
- callback
  
  function optional
  
  Chrome 111+
  
  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  
  ```
  () => void
  ```

#### Returns

- Promise&lt;void&gt;
  
  Chrome 111+
  
  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### get()
