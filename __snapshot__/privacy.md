# chrome.privacy

**Note:** The [Chrome Privacy Whitepaper](https://www.google.com/intl/en/landing/chrome/google-chrome-privacy-whitepaper.pdf) gives background detail regarding the features which this API can control.

## Description

Use the `chrome.privacy` API to control usage of the features in Chrome that can affect a user's privacy. This API relies on the [ChromeSetting prototype of the type API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/types/#ChromeSetting) for getting and setting Chrome's configuration.

## Permissions

`privacy`

You must declare the "privacy" permission in your extension's [manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest) to use the API. For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "privacy"
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Concepts and usage

Reading the current value of a Chrome setting is straightforward. You'll first need to find the property you're interested in, then you'll call `get()` on that object in order to retrieve its current value and your extension's level of control. For example, to determine if Chrome's credit card autofill feature is enabled, you'd write:

```
chrome.privacy.services.autofillCreditCardEnabled.get({}, function(details) {
  if (details.value) {
    console.log('Autofill is on!');
  } else {
    console.log('Autofill is off!');
  }
});
```

Changing the value of a setting is a little bit more complex, because you first must verify that your extension can control the setting. The user won't see any change to their settings if your extension toggles a setting that is either locked to a specific value by enterprise policies (`levelOfControl` will be set to "not\_controllable"), or if another extension is controlling the value (`levelOfControl` will be set to "controlled\_by\_other\_extensions"). The `set()` call will succeed, but the setting will be immediately overridden. As this might be confusing, it is advisable to warn the user when the settings they've chosen aren't practically applied.

**Note:** Full details about extensions' ability to control `ChromeSetting`s can be found under [`chrome.types.ChromeSetting`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/types#type-ChromeSetting).

This means that you ought to use the `get()` method to determine your level of access, and then only call `set()` if your extension can grab control over the setting (in fact if your extension can't control the setting it's probably a good idea to visually disable the feature to reduce user confusion):

```
chrome.privacy.services.autofillCreditCardEnabled.get({}, function(details) {
  if (details.levelOfControl === 'controllable_by_this_extension') {
    chrome.privacy.services.autofillCreditCardEnabled.set({ value: true }, function() {
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError === undefined) {
        console.log("Hooray, it worked!");
      } else {
        console.log("Sadness!", chrome.runtime.lastError);
      }
    });
  }
});
```

If you're interested in changes to a setting's value, add a listener to its `onChange` event. Among other uses, this will allow you to warn the user if a more recently installed extension grabs control of a setting, or if enterprise policy overrides your control. To listen for changes to credit card autofill status, for example, the following code would suffice:

```
chrome.privacy.services.autofillCreditCardEnabled.onChange.addListener(
  function (details) {
    // The new value is stored in `details.value`, the new level of control
    // in `details.levelOfControl`, and `details.incognitoSpecific` will be
    // `true` if the value is specific to Incognito mode.
  }
);
```
