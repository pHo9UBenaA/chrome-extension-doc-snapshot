Important:
This API works only on ChromeOS.


Description
Use the chrome.documentScan API to discover and retrieve images from attached document scanners.

The Document Scan API is designed to allow apps and extensions to view the
content of paper documents on an attached document scanner.

Permissions
documentScan

Availability

      Chrome 44+
      
        ChromeOS only
      
    
Availability for API members added later is shown with those members.



Concepts and usage

This API supports two means of scanning documents. If your use case can work
with any scanner and doesn't require control of the configuration, use the
scan() method. More complicated use cases require a combination of methods,
which are only supported in Chrome 124 and later.

Simple scanning

For simple use cases, meaning those that can work with any scanner and don't
require control of configuration, call scan(). This method takes a
ScanOptions object and returns a Promise that resolves with a ScanResults
object. The capabilities of this option are limited to the number of scans and
the MIME types that will be accepted by the caller. Scans are returned as URLs
for display in an <img> tag for a user interface.

Complex scanning

Complex scans are accomplished in three phases as described in this section.
This outline does not describe every method argument or every property returned
in a response. It is only intended to give you a general guide to writing scanner
code.
Note: Calling openScanner(),
getScannerList(), or
startScan() more than once will cancel operations
initiated by previous calls to these methods. See the descriptions of these
methods for specifics.
Discovery


Call getScannerList(). Available scanners are
returned in a Promise that resolves with a
GetScannerListResponse.


The response object contains an array of ScannerInfo
objects.
The array may contain multiple entries for a single scanner if that scanner
supports multiple protocols or connection methods.

Select a scanner from the returned array and save the value of its
scannerId property.

Use the properties of individual ScannerInfo objects
to distinguish among multiple objects for the same scanner. Objects from the
same scanner will have the same value for the deviceUuid property.
ScannerInfo also contains an imageFormats property containing an array of
supported image types.


Scanner configuration


Call openScanner(), passing in the saved scanner ID.
It returns a Promise that resolves with an OpenScannerResponse.
The response object contains:


A scannerHandle property, which you'll need to save.
An options property containing scanner-specific properties, which you'll
need to set. See Retrieve scanner options for more information.

(Optional) If you need the user to provide values for scanner options,
construct a user interface. You will need the scanner options provided by the
previous step, and you'll need to retrieve option groups provided by the
scanner. See Construct a user interface for more information.
Construct an array of OptionSetting objects using
programmatic or user-provided values. See Set scanner options for more
information.
Pass the array of OptionSetting objects to
setOptions() to set options for the scanner. It
returns a Promise that resolves with a
SetOptionsResponse. This object contains an
updated version of the scanner options retrieved in step 1 of scanner
configuration.

Since changing one
option can alter constraints on another option, you may need to repeat these
steps several times.


Scanning


Construct a StartScanOptions object and pass it
to startScan(). It returns a Promise that resolves
with a StartScanResponse. Its job property is
a handle that you will use to either read scan data or cancel the scan.
Pass the job handle to readScanData(). It returns a
Promise that resolves with a
ReadScanDataResponse object. If data was read
successfully, its result property equals SUCCESS and its data property
contains an
ArrayBuffer
with part of the scan. Note that estimatedCompletion contains an estimated
percentage of the total data that has been delivered so far.
Note: If result is SUCCESS, but data is empty, delay briefly before calling readScanData() again.
Repeat the previous step until the result property equals EOF or an error.


When the end of the scan is reached, call
closeScanner() with the scanner handle saved in step
3. It returns a Promise that resolves with a
CloseScannerResponse. Calling
cancelScan() at any time after the job is created will
end scanning.

Response objects

All methods return a Promise that resolves with a response object of some kind.
Most of these contain a result property whose value is a member of
OperationResult. Some properties of response objects
won't contain values unless the value of result has a specific value. These
relationships are described in the reference for each response object.

For example, OpenScannerResponse.scannerHandle will only have a value when
OpenScannerResponse.result equals SUCCESS.

Scanner options

Scanner options vary considerably by device. Consequently, it's not possible to
reflect scanner options directly within the documentScan API. To get around
this, the OpenScannerResponse (retrieved using
openScanner()) and the
SetOptionsResponse (the response object for
setOptions()) contain an options property which is an
object containing scanner-specific options. Each option is a key-value mapping
where the key is a device-specific option and the value is an instance of
ScannerOption.

The structure generally looks like this:
{
  "key1": { scannerOptionInstance }
  "key2": { scannerOptionInstance }
}

For example, imagine a scanner that returns options named "source" and
"resolution". The structure of the returned options object will look something
like the following example. For simplicity, only partial ScannerOption
responses are shown.
{
  "source": {
    "name": "source",
    "type": OptionType.STRING,
...
},
  "resolution": {
    "name": "resolution",
    "type": OptionType.INT,
...
  },
...
}

Construct a user interface

Though not required to use this API, you may want a user to choose the value for
a particular option. This requires a user interface. Use the
OpenScannerResponse (opened by
openScanner()) to retrieve the options for the attached
scanner as described in the previous section.

Some scanners group options in device-specific ways. They don't affect option
behaviors, but since these groups may be mentioned in a scanner's product
documentation, such groups should be shown to the user. You can retrieve these
groups by calling getOptionGroups(). This returns a
Promise that resolves with a
GetOptionGroupsResponse object. Its groups
property contains a scanner-specific array of groups. Use the information in
these groups to organize the options in the
OpenScannerResponse for display.
{
  scannerHandle: "123456",
  result: SUCCESS,
  groups: [
    {
      title: "Standard",
      members: [ "resolution", "mode", "source" ]
    }
  ]
}

As stated under Scanner configuration, changing one option can alter constraints
on another option. This is why
setOptionsResponse (the response object for
setOptions()) contains another options property. Use
this to update the user interface. Then repeat as needed until all options are
set.

Set scanner options

Set scanner options by passing an array of
OptionSetting objects to
setOptions(). For an example, see the following Scan one letter-size page section.

Examples

Retrieve a page as a blob

This example shows one way to retrieve a page from the scanner as a blob and
demonstrates use of startScan() and readScanData() using the value of
OperationResult.
async function pageAsBlob(handle) {
  let response = await chrome.documentScan.startScan(
      handle, {format: "image/jpeg"});
  if (response.result != chrome.documentScan.OperationResult.SUCCESS) {
    return null;
  }
  const job = response.job;

  let imgParts = [];

Scan one letter-size page

This example shows how to select a scanner, set its options, and open it. It
then retrieves the contents of a single page and closes the scanner. This process
demonstrates using getScannerList(), openScanner(), setOptions(), and
closeScanner(). Note that the contents of the page are retrieved by calling
the pageAsBlob() function from the previous example.
async function scan() {
    let response = await chrome.documentScan.getScannerList({ secure: true });
    let scanner = await chrome.documentScan.openScanner(
        response.scanners[0].scannerId);
    const handle = scanner.scannerHandle;

    let options = [];
    for (source of scanner.options["source"].constraint.list) {
        if (source.includes("ADF")) {
            options.push({
                name: "source",
                type: chrome.documentScan.OptionType.STRING,
                value: { value: source }
            });
            break;
        }
    }
    options.push({
        name: "tl-x",
        type: chrome.documentScan.OptionType.FIXED,
        value: 0.0
    });
    options.push({
        name: "br-x",
        type: chrome.documentScan.OptionType.FIXED,
        value: 215.9  // 8.5" in mm
    });
    options.push({
        name: "tl-y",
        type: chrome.documentScan.OptionType.FIXED,
        value: 0.0
    });
    options.push({
        name: "br-y",
        type: chrome.documentScan.OptionType.FIXED,
        value: 279.4  // 11" in mm
    });
    response = await chrome.documentScan.setOptions(handle, options);

    let imgBlob = await pageAsBlob(handle);
    if (imgBlob != null) {
        // Insert imgBlob into DOM, save to disk, etc
    }
    await chrome.documentScan.closeScanner(handle);
}

Show the configuration

As stated elsewhere, showing a scanner's configuration options to a user requires
calling getOptionGroups() in addition to the scanner options returned from a
call to openScanner(). This is so that options can be shown to users in
manufacturer-defined groups. This example shows how to do that.
async function showConfig() {
  let response = await chrome.documentScan.getScannerList({ secure: true });
  let scanner = await chrome.documentScan.openScanner(
      response.scanners[0].scannerId);
  let groups = await chrome.documentScan.getOptionGroups(scanner.scannerHandle);

  for (const group of groups.groups) {
    console.log("=== " + group.title + " ===");
    for (const member of group.members) {
      const option = scanner.options[member];
      if (option.isActive) {
        console.log("  " + option.name + " = " + option.value);
      } else {
        console.log("  " + option.name + " is inactive");
      }
    }
  }
}

        chrome.documentScan.cancelScan(  job: string,  callback?: function,)
      Cancels a started scan and returns a Promise that resolves with a CancelScanResponse object. If a callback is used, the object is passed to it instead.
Parameters
    
      job
      string
    The handle of an active scan job previously returned from a call to startScan.

    
      callback
      function optional

            Promise<GetScannerListResponse>
            
              
                Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
                backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
                promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

        chrome.documentScan.openScanner(  scannerId: string,  callback?: function,)
      Opens a scanner for exclusive access and returns a Promise that resolves with an OpenScannerResponse object. If a callback is passed to this function, returned data is passed to it instead.
Parameters
    
      scannerId
      string
    The ID of a scanner to be opened. This value is one returned from a previous call to getScannerList.

    
      callback
      function optional
    
          The callback parameter looks like:
          (response: OpenScannerResponse) => void
        
    
      response
      OpenScannerResponse
    
    
    Returns
          
            Promise<OpenScannerResponse>
            
              
                Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for
                backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The
                promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
              
            
        
      
    
      readScanData()
    
      
        Promise
      Chrome 125+
      
    
        chrome.documentScan.readScanData(  job: string,  callback?: function,)
      Reads the next chunk of available image data from an active job handle, and returns a Promise that resolves with a ReadScanDataResponse object. If a callback is used, the object is passed to it instead.
**Note:**It is valid for a response result to be SUCCESS with a zero-length data member. This means the scanner is still working but does not yet have additional data ready. The caller should wait a short time and try again.
When the scan job completes, the response will have the result value of EOF. This response may contain a final non-zero data member.
Parameters
    
      job
      string
    Active job handle previously returned from startScan.

    
      callback
      function optional
    
          The callback parameter looks like:

        chrome.documentScan.startScan(  scannerHandle: string,  options: StartScanOptions,  callback?: function,)
      Starts a scan on the specified scanner and returns a Promise that resolves with a StartScanResponse. If a callback is used, the object is passed to it instead. If the call was successful, the response includes a job handle that can be used in subsequent calls to read scan data or cancel a scan.
Parameters
    
      scannerHandle
      string
    The handle of an open scanner. This should be a value previously returned from a call to openScanner.

    
      options
      StartScanOptions
    A StartScanOptions object indicating the options to be used for the scan. The StartScanOptions.format property must match one of the entries returned in the scanner's ScannerInfo.
