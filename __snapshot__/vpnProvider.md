# chrome.vpnProvider

**Important:** This API works **only on ChromeOS**.

## Description

Use the `chrome.vpnProvider` API to implement a VPN client.

## Permissions

`vpnProvider`

## Availability

Chrome 43+ ChromeOS only

## Concepts and usage

Typical usage of `chrome.vpnProvider` is as follows:

- Create VPN configurations by calling [`createConfig()`](#method-createConfig). A VPN configuration is a persistent entry shown to the user in a ChromeOS UI. The user can select a VPN configuration from a list and connect to it or disconnect from it.
- Add listeners to the [`onPlatformMessage`](#event-onPlatformMessage), [`onPacketReceived`](#event-onPacketReceived), and [`onConfigRemoved`](#event-onConfigRemoved) events.
- When the user connects to the VPN configuration, [`onPlatformMessage`](#event-onPlatformMessage) will be received with the message `"connected"`. The period between the `"connected"` and `"disconnected"` messages is called a "VPN session". In this time period, the extension that receives the message is said to own the VPN session.
- Initiate connection to the VPN server and start the VPN client.
- Set the Parameters of the connection by calling [`setParameters()`](#method-setParameters).
- Notify the connection state as `"connected"` by calling [`notifyConnectionStateChanged()`](#method-notifyConnectionStateChanged).
- When the steps previous are completed without errors, a virtual tunnel is created to the network stack of ChromeOS. IP packets can be sent through the tunnel by calling [`sendPacket()`](#method-sendPacket) and any packets originating on the ChromeOS device will be received using the [`onPacketReceived`](#event-onPacketReceived) event handler.
- When the user disconnects from the VPN configuration, [`onPlatformMessage`](#event-onPlatformMessage) will be fired with the message `"disconnected"`.
- If the VPN configuration is no longer necessary, it can be destroyed by calling [`destroyConfig()`](#method-destroyConfig).

## Types

### Parameters

#### Properties

- address
  
  string
  
  IP address for the VPN interface in CIDR notation. IPv4 is currently the only supported mode.
- broadcastAddress
  
  string optional
  
  Broadcast address for the VPN interface. (default: deduced from IP address and mask)
- dnsServers
  
  string\[]
  
  A list of IPs for the DNS servers.
- domainSearch
  
  string\[] optional
  
  A list of search domains. (default: no search domain)
- exclusionList
  
  string\[]
  
  Exclude network traffic to the list of IP blocks in CIDR notation from the tunnel. This can be used to bypass traffic to and from the VPN server. When many rules match a destination, the rule with the longest matching prefix wins. Entries that correspond to the same CIDR block are treated as duplicates. Such duplicates in the collated (exclusionList + inclusionList) list are eliminated and the exact duplicate entry that will be eliminated is undefined.
- inclusionList
  
  string\[]
  
  Include network traffic to the list of IP blocks in CIDR notation to the tunnel. This parameter can be used to set up a split tunnel. By default no traffic is directed to the tunnel. Adding the entry "0.0.0.0/0" to this list gets all the user traffic redirected to the tunnel. When many rules match a destination, the rule with the longest matching prefix wins. Entries that correspond to the same CIDR block are treated as duplicates. Such duplicates in the collated (exclusionList + inclusionList) list are eliminated and the exact duplicate entry that will be eliminated is undefined.
- mtu
  
  string optional
  
  MTU setting for the VPN interface. (default: 1500 bytes)
- reconnect
  
  string optional
  
  Chrome 51+
  
  Whether or not the VPN extension implements auto-reconnection.
  
  If true, the `linkDown`, `linkUp`, `linkChanged`, `suspend`, and `resume` platform messages will be used to signal the respective events. If false, the system will forcibly disconnect the VPN if the network topology changes, and the user will need to reconnect manually. (default: false)
  
  This property is new in Chrome 51; it will generate an exception in earlier versions. try/catch can be used to conditionally enable the feature based on browser support.

### PlatformMessage

The enum is used by the platform to notify the client of the VPN session status.

#### Enum

"connected"  
Indicates that the VPN configuration connected.

"disconnected"  
Indicates that the VPN configuration disconnected.

"error"  
Indicates that an error occurred in VPN connection, for example a timeout. A description of the error is given as the error argument to onPlatformMessage.

"linkDown"  
Indicates that the default physical network connection is down.

"linkUp"  
Indicates that the default physical network connection is back up.

"linkChanged"  
Indicates that the default physical network connection changed, e.g. wifi-&gt;mobile.

"suspend"  
Indicates that the OS is preparing to suspend, so the VPN should drop its connection. The extension is not guaranteed to receive this event prior to suspending.

"resume"  
Indicates that the OS has resumed and the user has logged back in, so the VPN should try to reconnect.

### UIEvent

The enum is used by the platform to indicate the event that triggered `onUIEvent`.

#### Enum

"showAddDialog"  
Requests that the VPN client show the add configuration dialog box to the user.

"showConfigureDialog"  
Requests that the VPN client show the configuration settings dialog box to the user.

### VpnConnectionState

The enum is used by the VPN client to inform the platform of its current state. This helps provide meaningful messages to the user.

#### Enum

"connected"  
Specifies that VPN connection was successful.

"failure"  
Specifies that VPN connection has failed.

## Methods
