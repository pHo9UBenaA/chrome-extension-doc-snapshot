# chrome.windows

## Description

Use the `chrome.windows` API to interact with browser windows. You can use this API to create, modify, and rearrange windows in the browser.

## Permissions

When requested, a [`windows.Window`](#type-Window) contains an array of [`tabs.Tab`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#type-Tab) objects. You must declare the `"tabs"` permission in your [manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#manifest) if you need access to the [`url`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#property-Tab-url), [`pendingUrl`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#property-Tab-pendingUrl), [`title`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#property-Tab-title), or [`favIconUrl`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#property-Tab-favIconUrl) properties of [`tabs.Tab`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#type-Tab). For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": ["tabs"],
  ...
}
```

## Concepts and usage

### The current window

Many functions in the extension system take an optional `windowId` argument, which defaults to the current window.

The *current window* is the window that contains the code that is currently executing. It's important to realize that this can be different from the topmost or focused window.

For example, say an extension creates a few tabs or windows from a single HTML file, and that the HTML file contains a call to [`tabs.query()`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#method-query). The current window is the window that contains the page that made the call, no matter what the topmost window is.

In the case of [service workers](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/service-workers), the value of the current window falls back to the last active window. Under some circumstances, there may be no current window for background pages.

## Examples

To try this API, install the [windows API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/windows) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples) repository.

Two windows, each with one tab.

## Types

### CreateType

Chrome 44+

Specifies what type of browser window to create. 'panel' is deprecated and is available only to existing allowlisted extensions on Chrome OS.

#### Enum

"normal"  
Specifies the window as a standard window.

"popup"  
Specifies the window as a popup window.

"panel"  
Specifies the window as a panel.

### QueryOptions

Chrome 88+

#### Properties

- populate
  
  boolean optional
  
  If true, the [`windows.Window`](#type-Window) object has a `tabs` property that contains a list of the [`tabs.Tab`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs/#type-Tab) objects. The `Tab` objects only contain the `url`, `pendingUrl`, `title`, and `favIconUrl` properties if the extension's manifest file includes the `"tabs"` permission.
- windowTypes
  
  [WindowType](#type-WindowType)\[] optional
  
  If set, the [`windows.Window`](#type-Window) returned is filtered based on its type. If unset, the default filter is set to `['normal', 'popup']`.

### Window

#### Properties

- alwaysOnTop
  
  boolean
  
  Whether the window is set to be always on top.

- id
  
  number optional
  
  The ID of the window. Window IDs are unique within a browser session. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned an `ID` property; for example, when querying windows using the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API, in which case a session ID may be present.
- incognito
  
  boolean
  
  Whether the window is incognito.
- left
  
  number optional
  
  The offset of the window from the left edge of the screen in pixels. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned a `left` property; for example, when querying closed windows from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.
- sessionId
  
  string optional
  
  The session ID used to uniquely identify a window, obtained from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.
- state
  
  [WindowState](#type-WindowState) optional
  
  The state of this browser window.
- tabs
  
  [Tab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs/#type-Tab)\[] optional

  [WindowType](#type-WindowType) optional
  
  The type of browser window this is.
- width
  
  number optional
  
  The width of the window, including the frame, in pixels. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned a `width` property; for example, when querying closed windows from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.

### WindowState

Chrome 44+

The state of this browser window. In some circumstances a window may not be assigned a `state` property; for example, when querying closed windows from the [`sessions`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sessions/) API.

Normal window state (not minimized, maximized, or fullscreen).

"minimized"  
Minimized window state.
