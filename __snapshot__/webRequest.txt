Note: As of Manifest V3, the "webRequestBlocking" permission is no longer available for most extensions. Consider "declarativeNetRequest", which enables use the declarativeNetRequest API. Aside from "webRequestBlocking", the webRequest API is unchanged and available for normal use. Policy installed extensions can continue to use "webRequestBlocking".
Description
Use the chrome.webRequest API to observe and analyze traffic and to intercept, block, or modify requests in-flight.

Permissions
webRequest

You must declare the "webRequest" permission in the extension manifest to use the web request
API, along with the necessary host permissions. To intercept a sub-resource request, the
extension must have access to both the requested URL and its initiator. For example:
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "webRequest"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "*://*.google.com/*"
  ],
  ...
}

webRequestBlocking

Required to register blocking event handlers. As of Manifest V3, this is only
available to policy installed extensions.

webRequestAuthProvider

Required to use the onAuthRequired method. See
Handling authentication.





Concepts and usage

Life cycle of requests

The web request API defines a set of events that follow the life cycle of a web request. You can use
these events to observe and analyze traffic. Certain synchronous events will allow you to intercept,
block, or modify a request.

The event life cycle for successful requests is illustrated here, followed by event definitions:




onBeforeRequest (optionally synchronous)
Fires when a request is about to occur. This event is sent before any TCP connection is made and can
be used to cancel or redirect requests.
onBeforeSendHeaders (optionally synchronous)
Fires when a request is about to occur and the initial headers have been prepared. The event is
intended to allow extensions to add, modify, and delete request headers (*). The
onBeforeSendHeaders event is passed to all subscribers, so different subscribers may attempt to
modify the request; see the Implementation details section for how this is handled. This event
can be used to cancel the request.
onSendHeaders
Fires after all extensions have had a chance to modify the request headers, and presents the final
(*) version. The event is triggered before the headers are sent to the network. This event is
informational and handled asynchronously. It does not allow modifying or cancelling the request.
onHeadersReceived (optionally synchronous)
Fires each time that an HTTP(S) response header is received. Due to redirects and authentication
requests this can happen multiple times per request. This event is intended to allow extensions to
add, modify, and delete response headers, such as incoming Content-Type headers. The caching
directives are processed before this event is triggered, so modifying headers such as Cache-Control
has no influence on the browser's cache. It also allows you to cancel or redirect the request.
onAuthRequired (optionally synchronous)
Fires when a request requires authentication of the user. This event can be handled synchronously to
provide authentication credentials. Note that extensions may provide invalid credentials. Take care
not to enter an infinite loop by repeatedly providing invalid credentials. This can also be used to
cancel the request.
onBeforeRedirect
Fires when a redirect is about to be executed. A redirection can be triggered by an HTTP response
code or by an extension. This event is informational and handled asynchronously. It does not allow
you to modify or cancel the request.
onResponseStarted
Fires when the first byte of the response body is received. For HTTP requests, this means that the
status line and response headers are available. This event is informational and handled
asynchronously. It does not allow modifying or canceling the request.
onCompleted
Fires when a request has been processed successfully.
onErrorOccurred
Fires when a request could not be processed successfully.


The web request API guarantees that for each request, either onCompleted or onErrorOccurred is
fired as the final event with one exception: If a request is redirected to a data:// URL,
onBeforeRedirect is the last reported event.

*
Note that the web request API presents an abstraction of the network stack to the extension.
Internally, one URL request can be split into several HTTP requests (for example, to fetch individual
byte ranges from a large file) or can be handled by the network stack without communicating with the
network. For this reason, the API does not provide the final HTTP headers that are sent to the
network. For example, all headers that are related to caching are invisible to the extension.

The following headers are currently not provided to the onBeforeSendHeaders event. This list
is not guaranteed to be complete or stable.


Authorization
Cache-Control
Connection
Content-Length
Host
If-Modified-Since
If-None-Match
If-Range
Partial-Data
Pragma
Proxy-Authorization
Proxy-Connection
Transfer-Encoding


Starting from Chrome 79, request header modifications affect Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
checks. If modified headers for cross-origin requests do not meet the criteria, it will result in
sending a CORS preflight to ask the server if such headers can be accepted. If you really need to
modify headers in a way to violate the CORS protocol, you need to specify 'extraHeaders' in
opt_extraInfoSpec. On the other hand, response header modifications do not work to deceive CORS
checks. If you need to deceive the CORS protocol, you also need to specify 'extraHeaders' for the
response modifications.

Starting from Chrome 79, the webRequest API does not intercept CORS preflight requests and
responses by default. A CORS preflight for a request URL is visible to an extension if there is a
listener with 'extraHeaders' specified in opt_extraInfoSpec for the request URL.
onBeforeRequest can also take 'extraHeaders' from Chrome 79.

Starting from Chrome 79, the following request header is not provided and cannot be modified or
removed without specifying 'extraHeaders' in opt_extraInfoSpec:


Origin


Note: Modifying the Origin request header might not work as intended and may result in
unexpected errors in the response's CORS checks. This is because while extensions can only
modify the Origin request header, they can't change the request origin or initiator, which is
a concept defined in the Fetch spec to represent who initiates the request. In such a scenario, the
server may allow the CORS access for the modified request and put the header's Origin into the
Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in the response. But it won't match the immutable
request origin and will result in a CORS failure.

Starting from Chrome 72, if you need to modify responses before Cross Origin Read Blocking
(CORB) can block the response, you need to specify 'extraHeaders' in opt_extraInfoSpec.

Starting from Chrome 72, the following request headers are not provided and cannot be modified
or removed without specifying 'extraHeaders' in opt_extraInfoSpec:


Accept-Language
Accept-Encoding
Referer
Cookie


Starting from Chrome 72, the Set-Cookie response header is not provided and cannot be modified
or removed without specifying 'extraHeaders' in opt_extraInfoSpec.

Starting from Chrome 89, the X-Frame-Options response header cannot be effectively modified
or removed without specifying 'extraHeaders' in opt_extraInfoSpec.

Note: Specifying 'extraHeaders' in opt_extraInfoSpec may have a negative impact on
performance, hence it should only be used when really necessary.

The webRequest API only exposes requests that the extension has permission to see, given its host
permissions. Moreover, only the following schemes are accessible: http://, https://,
ftp://, file://, ws:// (since Chrome 58), wss:// (since Chrome 58), urn: (since Chrome 91), or
chrome-extension://. In addition, even certain requests with URLs using one of the above schemes
are hidden. These include chrome-extension://other_extension_id where other_extension_id is not
the ID of the extension to handle the request, https://www.google.com/chrome, and other sensitive
requests core to browser functionality. Also synchronous XMLHttpRequests from your extension are
hidden from blocking event handlers in order to prevent deadlocks. Note that for some of the
supported schemes the set of available events might be limited due to the nature of the
corresponding protocol. For example, for the file: scheme, only onBeforeRequest,
onResponseStarted, onCompleted, and onErrorOccurred may be dispatched.

Starting from Chrome 58, the webRequest API supports intercepting the WebSocket handshake request.
Since the handshake is done by means of an HTTP upgrade request, its flow fits into HTTP-oriented
webRequest model. Note that the API does not intercept:


Individual messages sent over an established WebSocket connection.
WebSocket closing connection.


Redirects are not supported for WebSocket requests.

Starting from Chrome 72, an extension will be able to intercept a request only if it has host
permissions to both the requested URL and the request initiator.

Starting from Chrome 96, the webRequest API supports intercepting the WebTransport over HTTP/3
handshake request. Since the handshake is done by means of an HTTP CONNECT request, its flow fits
into HTTP-oriented webRequest model. Note that:


Once the session is established, extensions cannot observe or intervene in the session via the
webRequest API.
Modifying HTTP request headers in onBeforeSendHeaders is ignored.
Redirects and authentications are not supported in WebTransport over HTTP/3.


Request IDs

Each request is identified by a request ID. This ID is unique within a browser session and the
context of an extension. It remains constant during the life cycle of a request and can be used
to match events for the same request. Note that several HTTP requests are mapped to one web request
in case of HTTP redirection or HTTP authentication.

Registering event listeners

To register an event listener for a web request, you use a variation on the usual addListener()
function. In addition to specifying a callback function, you have to specify a filter argument, and you may specify an optional extra info argument.

The three arguments to the web request API's addListener() have the following definitions:
var callback = function(details) {...};
var filter = {...};
var opt_extraInfoSpec = [...];

Here's an example of listening for the onBeforeRequest event:
chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
    callback, filter, opt_extraInfoSpec);

Each addListener() call takes a mandatory callback function as the first parameter. This callback
function is passed a dictionary containing information about the current URL request. The
information in this dictionary depends on the specific event type as well as the content of
opt_extraInfoSpec.

If the optional opt_extraInfoSpec array contains the string 'blocking' (only allowed for
specific events), the callback function is handled synchronously. That means that the request is
blocked until the callback function returns. In this case, the callback can return a
webRequest.BlockingResponse that determines the further life cycle of the request. Depending
on the context, this response allows canceling or redirecting a request (onBeforeRequest),
canceling a request or modifying headers (onBeforeSendHeaders, onHeadersReceived), and
canceling a request or providing authentication credentials (onAuthRequired).

If the optional opt_extraInfoSpec array contains the string 'asyncBlocking' instead (only
allowed for onAuthRequired), the extension can generate the webRequest.BlockingResponse
asynchronously.

The webRequest.RequestFilter filter allows limiting the requests for which events are
triggered in various dimensions:


URLs
URL patterns such as *://www.google.com/foo*bar.
Types
Request types such as main_frame (a document that is loaded for a top-level frame), sub_frame (a
document that is loaded for an embedded frame), and image (an image on a web site). See
webRequest.RequestFilter.
Tab ID
The identifier for one tab.
Window ID
The identifier for a window.


Depending on the event type, you can specify strings in opt_extraInfoSpec to ask for additional
information about the request. This is used to provide detailed information on request's data only
if explicitly requested.

Handling authentication

To handle requests for HTTP authentication, add the "webRequestAuthProvider"
permission to your manifest file:
{
  "permissions": [
    "webRequest",
    "webRequestAuthProvider"
  ]
}

Note that this permission is not required for a policy installed extension with
the "webRequestBlocking" permission.

To provide credentials synchronously:
chrome.webRequest.onAuthRequired.addListener((details) => {
    return {
      authCredentials: {
        username: 'guest',
        password: 'guest'
      }
    };
  },
  { urls: ['https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/guest/guest'] },
  ['blocking']
);

To provide credentials asynchronously:
chrome.webRequest.onAuthRequired.addListener((details, callback) => {
    callback({
      authCredentials: {
        username: 'guest',
        password: 'guest'
      }
    });
  },
  { urls: ['https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/guest/guest'] },
  ['asyncBlocking']
);

Implementation details

Several implementation details can be important to understand when developing an extension that uses
the web request API:

web_accessible_resources

When an extension uses webRequest APIs to redirect a public resource request to a resource that is not web accessible, it is blocked and will result in an error. The above holds true even if the resource that is not web accessible is owned by the redirecting extension. To declare resources for use with declarativeWebRequest APIs, the "web_accessible_resources" array must be declared and populated in the manifest as documented here.

Conflict resolution

In the current implementation of the web request API, a request is considered canceled if at
least one extension instructs to cancel the request. If an extension cancels a request, all
extensions are notified by an onErrorOccurred event. Only one extension can redirect a
request or modify a header at a time. If more than one extension attempts to modify the request, the
most recently installed extension wins, and all others are ignored. An extension is not notified if
its instruction to modify or redirect has been ignored.

Caching

Chrome employs two caches—an on-disk cache and a very fast in-memory cache. The lifetime of an
in-memory cache is attached to the lifetime of a render process, which roughly corresponds to a tab.
Requests that are answered from the in-memory cache are invisible to the web request API. If a
request handler changes its behavior (for example, the behavior according to which requests are
blocked), a simple page refresh might not respect this changed behavior. To ensure the behavior
change goes through, call handlerBehaviorChanged() to flush the in-memory cache. But don't do it
often; flushing the cache is a very expensive operation. You don't need to call
handlerBehaviorChanged() after registering or unregistering an event listener.

Timestamps

The timestamp property of web request events is only guaranteed to be internally consistent.
Comparing one event to another event will give you the correct offset between them, but comparing
them to the current time inside the extension (via (new Date()).getTime(), for instance) might
give unexpected results.

Error handling

If you try to register an event with invalid arguments, then a JavaScript error will be thrown, and
the event handler will not be registered. If an error is thrown while an event is handled or if an
event handler returns an invalid blocking response, an error message is logged to your extension's
console, and the handler is ignored for that request.

Examples

The following example illustrates how to block all requests to www.evil.com:
chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
  function(details) {
    return {cancel: details.url.indexOf("://www.evil.com/") != -1};
  },
  {urls: ["<all_urls>"]},
  ["blocking"]
);

As this function uses a blocking event handler, it requires the "webRequest" as well as the
"webRequestBlocking" permission in the manifest file.

The following example achieves the same goal in a more efficient way because requests that are not
targeted to www.evil.com do not need to be passed to the extension:
chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
  function(details) { return {cancel: true}; },
  {urls: ["*://www.evil.com/*"]},
  ["blocking"]
);

The following example illustrates how to delete the User-Agent header from all requests:
chrome.webRequest.onBeforeSendHeaders.addListener(
  function(details) {
    for (var i = 0; i < details.requestHeaders.length; ++i) {
      if (details.requestHeaders[i].name === 'User-Agent') {
        details.requestHeaders.splice(i, 1);
        break;
      }
    }
    return {requestHeaders: details.requestHeaders};
  },
  {urls: ["<all_urls>"]},
  ["blocking", "requestHeaders"]
);

To try the chrome.webRequest API,
install the webRequest sample from the chrome-extension-samples
repository.

Types
  
    
      BlockingResponse
    Returns value for event handlers that have the 'blocking' extraInfoSpec applied. Allows the event handler to modify network requests.
Properties
    
      authCredentials
      object optional
    Only used as a response to the onAuthRequired event. If set, the request is made using the supplied credentials.

    
      password
      string
    
    
      username
      string
    
    
    
      cancel
      boolean optional
    If true, the request is cancelled. This prevents the request from being sent. This can be used as a response to the onBeforeRequest, onBeforeSendHeaders, onHeadersReceived and onAuthRequired events.

    
      redirectUrl
      string optional
    Only used as a response to the onBeforeRequest and onHeadersReceived events. If set, the original request is prevented from being sent/completed and is instead redirected to the given URL. Redirections to non-HTTP schemes such as data: are allowed. Redirects initiated by a redirect action use the original request method for the redirect, with one exception: If the redirect is initiated at the onHeadersReceived stage, then the redirect will be issued using the GET method. Redirects from URLs with ws:// and wss:// schemes are ignored.

    
      requestHeaders
      HttpHeaders optional
    Only used as a response to the onBeforeSendHeaders event. If set, the request is made with these request headers instead.

    
      responseHeaders
      HttpHeaders optional
    Only used as a response to the onHeadersReceived event. If set, the server is assumed to have responded with these response headers instead. Only return responseHeaders if you really want to modify the headers in order to limit the number of conflicts (only one extension may modify responseHeaders for each request).

If the document of a (sub-)frame is loaded (type is main_frame or sub_frame), frameId indicates the ID of this frame, not the ID of the outer frame. Frame IDs are unique within a tab.
