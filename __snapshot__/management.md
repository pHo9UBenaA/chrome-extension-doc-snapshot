# chrome.management

## Description

The `chrome.management` API provides ways to manage installed apps and extensions.

## Permissions

`management`

You must declare the "management" permission in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest) to use the management API. For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "management"
  ],
  ...
}
```

[`management.getPermissionWarningsByManifest()`](#method-getPermissionWarningsByManifest), [`management.uninstallSelf()`](#method-uninstallSelf), and [`management.getSelf()`](#method-getSelf) do not require the management permission.
