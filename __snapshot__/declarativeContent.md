# chrome.declarativeContent

## Description

Use the `chrome.declarativeContent` API to take actions depending on the content of a page, without requiring permission to read the page's content.

## Permissions

`declarativeContent`

## Concepts and usage

**Key term:** An [extension's *action*](/docs/extensions/reference/api/action) controls the extension's toolbar icon.

The Declarative Content API lets you enable your extension's action depending on the URL of a web page, or if a CSS selector matches an element on the page, without needing to add [host permissions](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions#host-permissions) or inject a [content script](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts).

Use the [activeTab](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) permission to interact with a page after the user clicks on the extension's action.

### Rules

Rules consists of conditions and actions. If any of the conditions is fulfilled, all actions are executed. The actions are [`setIcon()`](#type-SetIcon) and [`showAction()`](#type-ShowAction).

The [`PageStateMatcher`](#type-PageStateMatcher) matches web pages if and only if all listed criteria are met. It can match a [page url](#page-url), a [css compound selector](#css) or the [bookmarked state](#bookmarked) of a page. The following rule enables the extension's action on Google pages when a password field is present:

```
let rule1 = {
  conditions: [
    new chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher({
      pageUrl: { hostSuffix: '.google.com', schemes: ['https'] },
      css: ["input[type='password']"]
    })
  ],
  actions: [ new chrome.declarativeContent.ShowAction() ]
};

```

**Success:** All conditions and actions are created using a constructor as shown in the previous example.

To also enable the extension's action for Google sites with a video, you can add a second condition, as each condition is sufficient to trigger all specified actions:

```
let rule2 = {
  conditions: [
    new chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher({
      pageUrl: { hostSuffix: '.google.com', schemes: ['https'] },
      css: ["input[type='password']"]
    }),
    new chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher({
      css: ["video"]
    })
  ],
  actions: [ new chrome.declarativeContent.ShowAction() ]
};
```

The [`onPageChanged`](#event-onPageChanged) event tests whether any rule has at least one fulfilled condition and executes the actions. Rules persist across browsing sessions; therefore, during extension installation time you should first use [`removeRules`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/events#remove_rules) to clear previously installed rules and then use [`addRules`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/events#add_rules) to register new ones.

```
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(function(details) {
  chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.removeRules(undefined, function() {
    chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.addRules([rule2]);
  });
});
```

**Note:** You should always register or unregister rules in bulk because each of these operations recreates internal data structures. This re-creation is computationally expensive but facilitates a faster matching algorithm.

With the [activeTab](/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) permission, your extension won't display any permission warnings and when the user clicks the extension action, it will only run on relevant pages.

### Page URL matching

The [`PageStateMatcher.pageurl`](#property-PageStateMatcher-pageUrl) matches when the URL criteria are fulfilled. The most common criteria are a concatenation of either host, path, or URL, followed by Contains, Equals, Prefix, or Suffix. The following table contains a few examples:

Criteria Matches `{ hostSuffix: 'google.com' }` All Google URLs `{ pathPrefix: '/docs/extensions'` } Extension docs URLs `{ urlContains: 'developer.chrome.com'` } All chrome developers docs URLs

All criteria are case sensitive. For a complete list of criteria, see [UrlFilter](/docs/extensions/reference/api/events#type-UrlFilter).

### CSS Matching

[`PageStateMatcher.css`](#property-PageStateMatcher-css) conditions must be [*compound selectors*](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors4/#compound), meaning that you can't include [combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors#combinators) like whitespace or "`>`" in your selectors. This helps Chrome match the selectors more efficiently.

Compound Selectors (OK) Complex Selectors (Not OK) `a` `div p` `iframe.special[src^='http']` `p>span.highlight` `ns|*` `p + ol` `#abcd:checked` `p::first-line`

CSS conditions only match displayed elements: if an element that matches your selector is `display:none` or one of its parent elements is `display:none`, it doesn't cause the condition to match. Elements styled with `visibility:hidden`, positioned off-screen, or hidden by other elements can still make your condition match.

### Bookmarked state matching

The [`PageStateMatcher.isBookmarked`](#property-PageStateMatcher-isBookmarked) condition allows matching of the bookmarked state of the current URL in the user's profile. To make use of this condition the "bookmarks" permission must be declared in the extension [manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest).

## Types

### ImageDataType

See [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageData).

#### Type

ImageData

### PageStateMatcher

Matches the state of a web page based on various criteria.

#### Properties

- constructor
  
  void
  
  The `constructor` function looks like:
  
  ```
  (arg: PageStateMatcher) => {...}
  ```
  
  - arg
    
    [PageStateMatcher](#type-PageStateMatcher)
  
  <!--THE END-->
  
  - returns
    
    [PageStateMatcher](#type-PageStateMatcher)
- css
  
  string\[] optional
  
  Matches if all of the CSS selectors in the array match displayed elements in a frame with the same origin as the page's main frame. All selectors in this array must be [compound selectors](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors4/#compound) to speed up matching. Note: Listing hundreds of CSS selectors or listing CSS selectors that match hundreds of times per page can slow down web sites.
- isBookmarked
  
  boolean optional
  
  Chrome 45+
  
  Matches if the bookmarked state of the page is equal to the specified value. Requres the [bookmarks permission](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions).
- pageUrl
  
  [UrlFilter](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/events/#type-UrlFilter) optional
  
  Matches if the conditions of the `UrlFilter` are fulfilled for the top-level URL of the page.

### RequestContentScript

Declarative event action that injects a content script.

**WARNING:** This action is still experimental and is not supported on stable builds of Chrome.

#### Properties

- constructor
  
  void
  
  The `constructor` function looks like:
  
  ```
  (arg: RequestContentScript) => {...}
  ```
  
  - arg
    
    [RequestContentScript](#type-RequestContentScript)
  
  <!--THE END-->
  
  - returns
    
    [RequestContentScript](#type-RequestContentScript)
- allFrames
  
  boolean optional
  
  Whether the content script runs in all frames of the matching page, or in only the top frame. Default is `false`.
- css
  
  string\[] optional
  
  Names of CSS files to be injected as a part of the content script.
- js
  
  string\[] optional
  
  Names of JavaScript files to be injected as a part of the content script.
- matchAboutBlank
  
  boolean optional
  
  Whether to insert the content script on `about:blank` and `about:srcdoc`. Default is `false`.

### SetIcon

Declarative event action that sets the n-dip square icon for the extension's [page action](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/pageAction/) or [browser action](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/browserAction/) while the corresponding conditions are met. This action can be used without [host permissions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions#host-permissions), but the extension must have a page or browser action.

Exactly one of `imageData` or `path` must be specified. Both are dictionaries mapping a number of pixels to an image representation. The image representation in `imageData` is an [ImageData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageData) object; for example, from a `canvas` element, while the image representation in `path` is the path to an image file relative to the extension's manifest. If `scale` screen pixels fit into a device-independent pixel, the `scale * n` icon is used. If that scale is missing, another image is resized to the required size.

#### Properties

- constructor
  
  void
  
  The `constructor` function looks like:
  
  ```
  (arg: SetIcon) => {...}
  ```
  
  - arg
    
    [SetIcon](#type-SetIcon)
  
  <!--THE END-->
  
  - returns
    
    [SetIcon](#type-SetIcon)
- imageData
  
  ImageData | object optional
  
  Either an `ImageData` object or a dictionary {size -&gt; ImageData} representing an icon to be set. If the icon is specified as a dictionary, the image used is chosen depending on the screen's pixel density. If the number of image pixels that fit into one screen space unit equals `scale`, then an image with size `scale * n` is selected, where *n* is the size of the icon in the UI. At least one image must be specified. Note that `details.imageData = foo` is equivalent to `details.imageData = {'16': foo}`.

### ShowAction

Chrome 97+

A declarative event action that sets the extension's toolbar [action](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/action/) to an enabled state while the corresponding conditions are met. This action can be used without [host permissions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/declare-permissions#host-permissions). If the extension has the [activeTab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab) permission, clicking the page action grants access to the active tab.

On pages where the conditions are not met the extension's toolbar action will be grey-scale, and clicking it will open the context menu, instead of triggering the action.

#### Properties

- constructor
  
  void
  
  The `constructor` function looks like:
  
  ```
  (arg: ShowAction) => {...}
  ```
  
  - arg
    
    [ShowAction](#type-ShowAction)
  
  <!--THE END-->
  
  - returns
    
    [ShowAction](#type-ShowAction)

### ShowPageAction

Deprecated since Chrome 97
