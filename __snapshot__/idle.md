# chrome.idle

## Description

Use the `chrome.idle` API to detect when the machine's idle state changes.

## Permissions

`idle`

You must declare the `"idle"` permission in your extension's manifest to use the idle API. For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "idle"
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Types

### IdleState

Chrome 44+

#### Enum

"active"

"idle"

"locked"

## Methods

### getAutoLockDelay()

Promise Chrome 73+ ChromeOS only

```
chrome.idle.getAutoLockDelay(
  callback?: function,
)
```

Gets the time, in seconds, it takes until the screen is locked automatically while idle. Returns a zero duration if the screen is never locked automatically. Currently supported on Chrome OS only.

#### Parameters

- callback
  
  function optional
  
  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  
  ```
  (delay: number) => void
  ```
  
  - delay
    
    number
    
    Time, in seconds, until the screen is locked automatically while idle. This is zero if the screen never locks automatically.

#### Returns

- Promise&lt;number&gt;
  
  Chrome 116+
  
  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### queryState()

Promise

```
chrome.idle.queryState(
  detectionIntervalInSeconds: number,
  callback?: function,
)
```

Returns "locked" if the system is locked, "idle" if the user has not generated any input for a specified number of seconds, or "active" otherwise.

#### Parameters

- detectionIntervalInSeconds
  
  number
  
  The system is considered idle if detectionIntervalInSeconds seconds have elapsed since the last user input detected.
- callback
  
  function optional
  
  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  
  ```
  (newState: IdleState) => void
  ```
  
  - newState
    
    [IdleState](#type-IdleState)

#### Returns

- Promise&lt;[IdleState](#type-IdleState)&gt;
  
  Chrome 116+
  
  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### setDetectionInterval()

```
chrome.idle.setDetectionInterval(
  intervalInSeconds: number,
)
```

Sets the interval, in seconds, used to determine when the system is in an idle state for onStateChanged events. The default interval is 60 seconds.

#### Parameters

- intervalInSeconds
  
  number
  
  Threshold, in seconds, used to determine when the system is in an idle state.

## Events

### onStateChanged

```
chrome.idle.onStateChanged.addListener(
  callback: function,
)
```

Fired when the system changes to an active, idle or locked state. The event fires with "locked" if the screen is locked or the screensaver activates, "idle" if the system is unlocked and the user has not generated any input for a specified number of seconds, and "active" when the user generates input on an idle system.

#### Parameters

- callback
  
  function
  
  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  
  ```
  (newState: IdleState) => void
  ```
  
  - newState
    
    [IdleState](#type-IdleState)
