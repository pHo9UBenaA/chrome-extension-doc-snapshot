# chrome.gcm

## Description

Use `chrome.gcm` to enable apps and extensions to send and receive messages through [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/) (FCM).

## Permissions

`gcm`

## Properties

### MAX\_MESSAGE\_SIZE

The maximum size (in bytes) of all key/value pairs in a message.

#### Value

4096

## Methods

### register()

Promise

```
chrome.gcm.register(
  senderIds: string[],
  callback?: function,
)
```

Registers the application with FCM. The registration ID will be returned by the `callback`. If `register` is called again with the same list of `senderIds`, the same registration ID will be returned.

#### Parameters

- senderIds
  
  string\[]
  
  A list of server IDs that are allowed to send messages to the application. It should contain at least one and no more than 100 sender IDs.
- callback
  
  function optional
  
  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  
  ```
  (registrationId: string) => void
  ```
  
  - registrationId
    
    string
    
    A registration ID assigned to the application by the FCM.

#### Returns

- Promise&lt;string&gt;
  
  Chrome 116+
  
  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### send()

Promise

```
chrome.gcm.send(
  message: object,
  callback?: function,
)
```

Sends a message according to its contents.

#### Parameters

- message
  
  object
  
  A message to send to the other party via FCM.
  
  - data
    
    object
    
    Message data to send to the server. Case-insensitive `goog.` and `google`, as well as case-sensitive `collapse_key` are disallowed as key prefixes. Sum of all key/value pairs should not exceed [`gcm.MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE`](#property-MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE).
  - destinationId
    
    string
    
    The ID of the server to send the message to as assigned by [Google API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).
  - messageId
    
    string
    
    The ID of the message. It must be unique for each message in scope of the applications. See the [Cloud Messaging documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/js/client) for advice for picking and handling an ID.
  - timeToLive
    
    number optional
    
    Time-to-live of the message in seconds. If it is not possible to send the message within that time, an onSendError event will be raised. A time-to-live of 0 indicates that the message should be sent immediately or fail if it's not possible. The default value of time-to-live is 86,400 seconds (1 day) and the maximum value is 2,419,200 seconds (28 days).
- callback
  
  function optional
  
  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  
  ```
  (messageId: string) => void
  ```
  
  - messageId
    
    string
    
    The ID of the message that the callback was issued for.

#### Returns

- Promise&lt;string&gt;
  
  Chrome 116+
  
  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### unregister()

Promise

```
chrome.gcm.unregister(
  callback?: function,
)
```

Unregisters the application from FCM.

#### Parameters

- callback
  
  function optional
  
  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  
  ```
  () => void
  ```

#### Returns

- Promise&lt;void&gt;
  
  Chrome 116+
  
  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.
