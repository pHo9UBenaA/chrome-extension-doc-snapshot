# chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow

## Description

Use the `chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow` API to interact with the inspected window: obtain the tab ID for the inspected page, evaluate the code in the context of the inspected window, reload the page, or obtain the list of resources within the page.

See [DevTools APIs summary](/docs/extensions/how-to/devtools/extend-devtools) for general introduction to using Developer Tools APIs.

The [`tabId`](#property-tabId) property provides the tab identifier that you can use with the [`chrome.tabs.*`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs) API calls. However, please note that `chrome.tabs.*` API is not exposed to the Developer Tools extension pages due to security considerations—you will need to pass the tab ID to the background page and invoke the `chrome.tabs.*` API functions from there.

The `reload` method may be used to reload the inspected page. Additionally, the caller can specify an override for the user agent string, a script that will be injected early upon page load, or an option to force reload of cached resources.

Use the `getResources` call and the `onResourceContent` event to obtain the list of resources (documents, stylesheets, scripts, images etc) within the inspected page. The `getContent` and `setContent` methods of the `Resource` class along with the `onResourceContentCommitted` event may be used to support modification of the resource content, for example, by an external editor.

## Manifest

The following keys must be declared [in the manifest](/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest) to use this API.

`"devtools_page"`

## Execute code in the inspected window

The `eval` method provides the ability for extensions to execute JavaScript code in the context of the inspected page. This method is powerful when used in the right context and dangerous when used inappropriately. Use the [`tabs.executeScript`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#method-executeScript) method unless you need the specific functionality that the `eval` method provides.

Here are the main differences between the `eval` and `tabs.executeScript` methods:

- The `eval` method does not use an isolated world for the code being evaluated, so the JavaScript state of the inspected window is accessible to the code. Use this method when access to the JavaScript state of the inspected page is required.
- The execution context of the code being evaluated includes the [Developer Tools console API](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/). For example, the code can use `inspect` and `$0`.
- The evaluated code may return a value that is passed to the extension callback. The returned value has to be a valid JSON object (it may contain only primitive JavaScript types and acyclic references to other JSON objects). *Please observe extra care while processing the data received from the inspected page—the execution context is essentially controlled by the inspected page; a malicious page may affect the data being returned to the extension.*

**Caution:** Due to the security considerations explained above, the [`scripting.executeScript`](/docs/extensions/reference/api/scripting#method-executeScript) method is the preferred way for an extension to access DOM data of the inspected page in cases where the access to JavaScript state of the inspected page is not required.

Note that a page can include multiple different JavaScript execution contexts. Each frame has its own context, plus an additional context for each extension that has content scripts running in that frame.

By default, the `eval` method executes in the context of the main frame of the inspected page.

The `eval` method takes an optional second argument that you can use to specify the context in which the code is evaluated. This *options* object can contain one or more of the following keys:

`frameURL`

Use to specify a frame other than the inspected page's main frame.

`contextSecurityOrigin`

Use to select a context within the specified frame according to its [web origin](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6454.txt).

`useContentScriptContext`

If true, execute the script in the same context as the extensions's content scripts. (Equivalent to specifying the extensions's own web orgin as the context security origin.) This can be used to exchange data with the content script.

## Examples

The following code checks for the version of jQuery used by the inspected page:

```
chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow.eval(
  "jQuery.fn.jquery",
  function(result, isException) {
    if (isException) {
      console.log("the page is not using jQuery");
    } else {
      console.log("The page is using jQuery v" + result);
    }
  }
);
```

## Methods

### eval()

```
chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow.eval(
  expression: string,
  options?: object,
  callback?: function,
): void
```

Evaluates a JavaScript expression in the context of the main frame of the inspected page. The expression must evaluate to a JSON-compliant object, otherwise an exception is thrown. The eval function can report either a DevTools-side error or a JavaScript exception that occurs during evaluation. In either case, the `result` parameter of the callback is `undefined`. In the case of a DevTools-side error, the `isException` parameter is non-null and has `isError` set to true and `code` set to an error code. In the case of a JavaScript error, `isException` is set to true and `value` is set to the string value of thrown object.

#### Parameters

- expression
  
  string
  
  An expression to evaluate.
- options
  
  object optional
  
  The options parameter can contain one or more options.
  
  - frameURL
    
    string optional
    
    If specified, the expression is evaluated on the iframe whose URL matches the one specified. By default, the expression is evaluated in the top frame of the inspected page.
  - scriptExecutionContext
    
    string optional
    
    Chrome 107+
    
    Evaluate the expression in the context of a content script of an extension that matches the specified origin. If given, scriptExecutionContext overrides the 'true' setting on useContentScriptContext.
  - useContentScriptContext
    
    boolean optional
    
    Evaluate the expression in the context of the content script of the calling extension, provided that the content script is already injected into the inspected page. If not, the expression is not evaluated and the callback is invoked with the exception parameter set to an object that has the `isError` field set to true and the `code` field set to `E_NOTFOUND`.
- callback
  
  function optional
  
  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  
  ```
  (result: object, exceptionInfo: object) => void
  ```
  
  - result
    
    object
    
    The result of evaluation.
  - exceptionInfo
    
    object
    
    An object providing details if an exception occurred while evaluating the expression.
    
    - code
      
      string
      
      Set if the error occurred on the DevTools side before the expression is evaluated.
    - description
      
      string
      
      Set if the error occurred on the DevTools side before the expression is evaluated.
    - details
      
      any\[]
      
      Set if the error occurred on the DevTools side before the expression is evaluated, contains the array of the values that may be substituted into the description string to provide more information about the cause of the error.
    - isError
      
      boolean
      
      Set if the error occurred on the DevTools side before the expression is evaluated.
    - isException
      
      boolean
      
      Set if the evaluated code produces an unhandled exception.
    - value
      
      string
      
      Set if the evaluated code produces an unhandled exception.

### getResources()

```
chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow.getResources(
  callback: function,
): void
```

Retrieves the list of resources from the inspected page.

#### Parameters

- callback
  
  function
  
  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  
  ```
  (resources: Resource[]) => void
  ```
  
  - resources
    
    [Resource](#type-Resource)\[]
    
    The resources within the page.

### reload()

```
chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow.reload(
  reloadOptions?: object,
): void
```

Reloads the inspected page.

#### Parameters

- reloadOptions
  
  object optional
  
  - ignoreCache
    
    boolean optional
    
    When true, the loader will bypass the cache for all inspected page resources loaded before the `load` event is fired. The effect is similar to pressing Ctrl+Shift+R in the inspected window or within the Developer Tools window.
  - injectedScript
    
    string optional
    
    If specified, the script will be injected into every frame of the inspected page immediately upon load, before any of the frame's scripts. The script will not be injected after subsequent reloads—for example, if the user presses Ctrl+R.
  - userAgent
    
    string optional
    
    If specified, the string will override the value of the `User-Agent` HTTP header that's sent while loading the resources of the inspected page. The string will also override the value of the `navigator.userAgent` property that's returned to any scripts that are running within the inspected page.
