# chrome.webNavigation

## Description

Use the `chrome.webNavigation` API to receive notifications about the status of navigation requests in-flight.

## Permissions

`webNavigation`

All `chrome.webNavigation` methods and events require you to declare the `"webNavigation"` permission in the [extension manifest](/docs/extensions/reference/manifest). For example:

```
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "webNavigation"
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Concepts and usage

### Event order

For a navigation that is successfully completed, events are fired in the following order:

```
onBeforeNavigate -> onCommitted -> [onDOMContentLoaded] -> onCompleted
```

Any error that occurs during the process results in an `onErrorOccurred` event. For a specific navigation, there are no further events fired after `onErrorOccurred`.

If a navigating frame contains subframes, its `onCommitted` is fired before any of its children's `onBeforeNavigate`; while `onCompleted` is fired after all of its children's `onCompleted`.

If the reference fragment of a frame is changed, a `onReferenceFragmentUpdated` event is fired. This event can fire any time after `onDOMContentLoaded`, even after `onCompleted`.

If the history API is used to modify the state of a frame (e.g. using `history.pushState()`, a `onHistoryStateUpdated` event is fired. This event can fire any time after `onDOMContentLoaded`.

If a navigation restored a page from the [Back Forward Cache](https://web.dev/bfcache/), the `onDOMContentLoaded` event won't fire. The event is not fired because the content has already completed load when the page was first visited.

If a navigation was triggered using [Chrome Instant](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/177873) or [Instant Pages](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/1385029), a completely loaded page is swapped into the current tab. In that case, an `onTabReplaced` event is fired.

### Relation to webRequest events

There is no defined ordering between events of the [webRequest API](/docs/extensions/reference/api/webRequest) and the events of the webNavigation API. It is possible that webRequest events are still received for frames that already started a new navigation, or that a navigation only proceeds after the network resources are already fully loaded.

In general, the webNavigation events are closely related to the navigation state that is displayed in the UI, while the webRequest events correspond to the state of the network stack which is generally opaque to the user.

### Tab IDs

Not all navigating tabs correspond to actual tabs in Chrome's UI, for example, a tab that is being pre-rendered. Such tabs are not accessible using the [tabs API](/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs) nor can you request information about them by calling `webNavigation.getFrame()` or `webNavigation.getAllFrames()`. Once such a tab is swapped in, an `onTabReplaced` event is fired and they become accessible through these APIs.

### Timestamps

It's important to note that some technical oddities in the OS's handling of distinct Chrome processes can cause the clock to be skewed between the browser itself and extension processes. That means that the `timeStamp` property of the `WebNavigation` event `timeStamp` property is only guaranteed to be *internally* consistent. Comparing one event to another event will give you the correct offset between them, but comparing them to the current time inside the extension (using `(new Date()).getTime()`, for instance) might give unexpected results.

### Frame IDs

Frames within a tab can be identified by a frame ID. The frame ID of the main frame is always 0, the ID of child frames is a positive number. Once a document is constructed in a frame, its frame ID remains constant during the lifetime of the document. As of Chrome 49, this ID is also constant for the lifetime of the frame (across multiple navigations).

Due to the multi-process nature of Chrome, a tab might use different processes to render the source and destination of a web page. Therefore, if a navigation takes place in a new process, you might receive events both from the new and the old page until the new navigation is committed (i.e. the `onCommitted` event is sent for the new main frame). In other words, it is possible to have more than one pending sequence of webNavigation events with the same `frameId`. The sequences can be distinguished by the `processId` key.

Also note that during a provisional load the process might be switched several times. This happens when the load is redirected to a different site. In this case, you will receive repeated `onBeforeNavigate` and `onErrorOccurred` events, until you receive the final `onCommitted` event.

Another concept that is problematic with extensions is the lifecycle of the frame. A frame hosts a document (which is associated with a committed URL). The document can change (say by navigating) but the *frameId* won't, and so it is difficult to associate that something happened in a specific document with just *frameIds*. We are introducing a concept of a [documentId](/docs/extensions/reference/webNavigation#method-getFrame:%7E:text=retrieve%20information%20about.-,documentId,-string%C2%A0optional) which is a unique identifier per document. If a frame is navigated and opens a new document the identifier will change. This field is useful for determining when pages change their lifecycle state (between prerender/active/cached) because it remains the same.

### Transition types and qualifiers

The `webNavigation` `onCommitted` event has a `transitionType` and a `transitionQualifiers` property. The *transition type* is the same as used in the [history API](/docs/extensions/reference/api/history#transition_types) describing how the browser navigated to this particular URL. In addition, several *transition qualifiers* can be returned that further define the navigation.

The following transition qualifiers exist:

Transition qualifierDescription"client\_redirect"One or more redirects caused by JavaScript or meta refresh tags on the page happened during the navigation."server\_redirect"One or more redirects caused by HTTP headers sent from the server happened during the navigation."forward\_back"The user used the Forward or Back button to initiate the navigation."from\_address\_bar"The user initiated the navigation from the address bar (aka Omnibox).

## Examples

To try this API, install the [webNavigation API example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/webNavigation) from the [chrome-extension-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples) repository.
