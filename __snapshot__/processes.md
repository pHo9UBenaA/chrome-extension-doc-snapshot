  The most recent measurement of the process JavaScript memory used, in bytes. Only available when receiving the object as part of a callback from onUpdated or onUpdatedWithMemory.

  [TaskInfo](#type-TaskInfo)\[]
  
  Array of TaskInfos representing the tasks running on this process.

### TaskInfo

#### Properties

- tabId
  
  number optional
  
  Optional tab ID, if this task represents a tab running on a renderer process.
- title
  
  string
  
  The title of the task.

## Methods

### getProcessIdForTab()

Promise

```
chrome.processes.getProcessIdForTab(
  tabId: number,
  callback?: function,
)
```

Returns the ID of the renderer process for the specified tab.

#### Parameters

- tabId
  
  number
  
  The ID of the tab for which the renderer process ID is to be returned.
- callback
  
  function optional
  
  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  
  ```
  (processId: number) => void
  ```
  
  - processId
    
    number
    
    Process ID of the tab's renderer process.

#### Returns

- Promise&lt;number&gt;
  
  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### getProcessInfo()

Promise

```
chrome.processes.getProcessInfo(
  processIds: number | number[],
  includeMemory: boolean,
  callback?: function,
)
```

Retrieves the process information for each process ID specified.

#### Parameters

- processIds
  
  number | number\[]
  
  The list of process IDs or single process ID for which to return the process information. An empty list indicates all processes are requested.
- includeMemory
  
  boolean
  
  True if detailed memory usage is required. Note, collecting memory usage information incurs extra CPU usage and should only be queried for when needed.
- callback
  
  function optional
  
  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  
  ```
  (processes: object) => void
  ```
  
  - processes
    
    object
    
    A dictionary of [`Process`](#type-Process) objects for each requested process that is a live child process of the current browser process, indexed by process ID. Metrics requiring aggregation over time will not be populated in each Process object.

#### Returns

- Promise&lt;object&gt;
  
  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

### terminate()

Promise

```
chrome.processes.terminate(
  processId: number,
  callback?: function,
)
```

Terminates the specified renderer process. Equivalent to visiting about:crash, but without changing the tab's URL.

#### Parameters

- processId
  
  number
  
  The ID of the process to be terminated.
- callback
  
  function optional
  
  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  
  ```
  (didTerminate: boolean) => void
  ```
  
  - didTerminate
    
    boolean
    
    True if terminating the process was successful, and false otherwise.

#### Returns

- Promise&lt;boolean&gt;
  
  Promises are supported in Manifest V3 and later, but callbacks are provided for backward compatibility. You cannot use both on the same function call. The promise resolves with the same type that is passed to the callback.

## Events

### onCreated

```
chrome.processes.onCreated.addListener(
  callback: function,
)
```

Fired each time a process is created, providing the corrseponding Process object.

#### Parameters

  ```
  (process: Process) => void

#### Parameters

- callback
  
  function
  
  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  
  ```
  (processId: number, exitType: number, exitCode: number) => void

  - processId
    
    number
  - exitType
    
    number
  - exitCode
    
    number

### onUnresponsive

```
chrome.processes.onUnresponsive.addListener(
  callback: function,

```

Fired each time a process becomes unresponsive, providing the corrseponding Process object.

#### Parameters

  function
  
  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  
  ```
  (process: Process) => void

  - process
    
    [Process](#type-Process)

### onUpdated

```
chrome.processes.onUpdated.addListener(
  callback: function,
)
```

Fired each time the Task Manager updates its process statistics, providing the dictionary of updated Process objects, indexed by process ID.

#### Parameters

- callback
  
  function
  
  The `callback` parameter looks like:

  - processes
    
    object

### onUpdatedWithMemory

```
chrome.processes.onUpdatedWithMemory.addListener(
  callback: function,
)
```

Fired each time the Task Manager updates its process statistics, providing the dictionary of updated Process objects, indexed by process ID. Identical to onUpdate, with the addition of memory usage details included in each Process object. Note, collecting memory usage information incurs extra CPU usage and should only be listened for when needed.

#### Parameters

- callback
  
  function
  
  The `callback` parameter looks like:
  
  ```
  (processes: object) => void
  ```
